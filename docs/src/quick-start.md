# Quick Start

In this quick start, we list several common use cases for Yao before you
go deeper into the manual.

## Create a quantum register
## Create quantum circuit with Yao blocks
## Create Hamiltonian with Yao blocks
## Automatic differentiate a Yao block
## Combine Yao with ChainRules/Zygote
## Symbolic calculation with Yao block
## Plot quantum circuits
## Convert quantum circuits to tensor network
## Simpllify quantum circuit with ZX calculus
